# Programming with C# ðŸš€

Welcome to the Programming with C# repository! This collection showcases a series of programs written in C# that cover a range of topics, from basic operators and control statements to advanced concepts like inheritance, polymorphism, exception handling, and delegates.

## Table of Contents

1. **Operators in C#**
   - Program 01: Illustrating various operators like arithmetic, relational, logical & bitwise operator.

2. **Control Statements**
   - Program 02: Illustrating the use of conditional statements in C#.
   - Program 03: Illustrating the use of iteration (loop) statements in C#.

3. **Arrays in C#**
   - Program 04: Illustrating the concept of arrays in C#.

4. **Employee Class**
   - Program 05: Creating a class `Employee` with private fields (`name`, `emp_id`, `salary`) and a static field (`no_of_employee`). Demonstrating the use of properties, constructor, and methods.

5. **Account Class**
   - Program 06: Creating a class `Account` with private fields (`name`, `account_no`, `balance`) and static fields (`no_of_accounts`, `interest_rate`). Demonstrating static methods, instance methods, and constructors.

6. **Person and Student Classes**
   - Program 07: Creating a class `Person` with fields (`name`, `age`). Deriving a class `Student` with additional fields (`roll no`, `University name`, `branch`). Demonstrating inheritance and polymorphism.

7. **Runtime Polymorphism**
   - Program 08: Demonstrating the concept of runtime polymorphism using virtual methods.

8. **Abstract Class and Method**
   - Program 09: Demonstrating the concept of abstract methods and abstract classes.

9. **Complex Number Operations**
   - Program 10: Defining a class representing a complex number and overloading the "+" operator.

10. **Inheritance Concepts**
   - Program 11: Demonstrating multilevel inheritance.
   - Program 12: Demonstrating hierarchical inheritance.

11. **Interface and Implementing Classes**
   - Program 13: Creating an interface `Shape` with the `getArea()` method. Implementing three classes (`Rectangle`, `Circle`, `Triangle`) that implement the `Shape` interface.

12. **Exception Handling**
   - Program 14: Handling exceptions when multiplying two numbers.
   - Program 15: Handling `DivideByZeroException` when dividing two numbers.
   - Program 16: Handling exceptions when inputting a numeric integer.
   - Program 17: Handling exceptions when calculating the average value of an array.

13. **Indexer in C#**
   - Program 18: Illustrating the use of indexer in C#.

14. **Delegates in C#**
   - Program 19: Illustrating the use of singlecast delegates.
   - Program 20: Demonstrating the concept of multicast delegates.
